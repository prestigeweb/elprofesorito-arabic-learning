## 1. Domain Registration

### Step 1.1: Choose a Domain Registrar

Popular domain registrars (all are beginner-friendly):
- **Namecheap** (Recommended for beginners) - https://www.namecheap.com
- **Google Domains** - https://domains.google
- **GoDaddy** - https://www.godaddy.com
- **Cloudflare** - https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar

### Step 1.2: Search for Your Domain

1. Go to your chosen registrar's website
2. Enter your desired domain name (e.g., `elprofesorito-arabic.com` or `elprofesoritoeg.com`)
3. Check availability
4. If available, add it to your cart

### Step 1.3: Purchase Your Domain

1. Select the domain extension (.com, .org, .net, etc.)
   - **.com** is most common and trusted
   - Consider country-specific extensions if targeting a specific region
2. Choose registration period (1-10 years)
   - Start with 1 year if unsure
3. Add domain privacy protection (recommended - hides your personal info)
4. Complete the purchase

**Cost:** Typically $10-15/year for .com domains

### Step 1.4: Verify Your Email

After purchase, verify your email address with the registrar. This is required to manage your domain.

## 5. Connecting Your Domain

### Step 5.1: Get Your Hosting URL

- **Vercel:** Your site URL is `your-project.vercel.app`
- **Netlify:** Your site URL is `your-project.netlify.app`

### Step 5.2: Add Domain in Hosting Platform

#### For Vercel:

1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Click "Settings" → "Domains"
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `elprofesoritoeg.com`)
4. Click "Add"
5. Vercel will show you DNS records to add

#### For Netlify:

1. Go to "Site settings" → "Domain management"
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Enter your domain
4. Follow the instructions

### Step 5.3: Configure DNS Records

You need to add DNS records at your domain registrar. Here's how:

#### If using Vercel:

1. **Option A: Use Vercel's Nameservers (Easiest)**
   - In Vercel, you'll see nameservers like:
     - `ns1.vercel-dns.com`
     - `ns2.vercel-dns.com`
   - Go to your domain registrar
   - Find "DNS Settings" or "Nameservers"
   - Replace existing nameservers with Vercel's
   - Save and wait 24-48 hours for propagation

2. **Option B: Add A/CNAME Records (More Control)**
   - In your domain registrar's DNS settings, add:
     - **Type:** `A` or `CNAME`
     - **Name:** `@` (for root domain) or `www` (for www subdomain)
     - **Value:** Vercel will provide this (usually an IP or CNAME target)
   - For `www` subdomain, add:
     - **Type:** `CNAME`
     - **Name:** `www`
     - **Value:** `cname.vercel-dns.com`

#### If using Netlify:

1. Netlify will provide DNS records
2. Go to your domain registrar's DNS settings
3. Add the records Netlify provides:
   - Usually an `A` record for root domain
   - A `CNAME` record for `www` subdomain

### Step 5.4: Wait for DNS Propagation

- DNS changes can take 24-48 hours to propagate globally
- You can check status at: https://www.whatsmydns.net
- Enter your domain and check if it points to your hosting

### Step 5.5: SSL Certificate (Automatic)

- Both Vercel and Netlify automatically provide free SSL certificates
- Your site will be accessible via `https://yourdomain.com`
- This happens automatically once DNS is configured

## 6. Post-Deployment Steps

### Step 6.1: Verify Everything Works

Test on your actual domain:
- [ ] Site loads at `https://yourdomain.com`
- [ ] All pages work
- [ ] Contact forms submit correctly
- [ ] Images load properly
- [ ] Mobile view works
- [ ] All links work

### Step 6.2: Set Up Redirects (Optional but Recommended)

Set up redirects so both `yourdomain.com` and `www.yourdomain.com` work:

**In Vercel:**
- Go to Settings → Domains
- Add both `yourdomain.com` and `www.yourdomain.com`
- Vercel handles redirects automatically

**In Netlify:**
- Add both domains
- Set one as primary (redirects the other)

### Step 6.3: Update Environment Variables if Needed

If you need to change any environment variables:
1. Go to your hosting platform's dashboard
2. Find "Environment Variables" or "Site Settings"
3. Update the values
4. Redeploy (usually automatic, or click "Redeploy")

### Step 6.4: Set Up Automatic Deployments

Both Vercel and Netlify automatically deploy when you push to GitHub:

1. Make changes to your code
2. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update content"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. Your site will automatically rebuild and deploy (usually in 1-3 minutes)

### Step 6.5: Monitor Your Site

- Check your hosting dashboard regularly
- Set up email notifications for deployment status
- Monitor site uptime (both platforms provide this)

## Troubleshooting

### Domain Not Working After 48 Hours

1. Check DNS propagation: https://www.whatsmydns.net
2. Verify DNS records are correct in your registrar
3. Contact your hosting provider's support

### Site Shows "Not Found" or 404

1. Check that build completed successfully
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Check that `dist` folder is being deployed
4. Review build logs in your hosting dashboard

### Environment Variables Not Working

1. Make sure all variables start with `VITE_`
2. Redeploy after adding/changing variables
3. Check variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### SSL Certificate Issues

- Usually resolves automatically within 24 hours
- If not, contact hosting support
- Make sure DNS is correctly configured
